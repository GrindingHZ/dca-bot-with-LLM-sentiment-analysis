A weekly **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** trading bot powered by **LLM-based sentiment analysis** to trade the **Magnificent 7 stocks** (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META, NVDA, TSLA).

## üîç Strategy Overview

This bot implements a hybrid **indexing + sentiment-based DCA strategy**:

- **Week 1**: Allocate **50% of the portfolio** based on **market capitalization weights** (similar to SPY or QQQ).
- **Subsequent Weeks**:
  - **Buy** stocks with **positive sentiment ‚â• 0.5** using ~5% of the portfolio (or available cash).
  - **Sell** stocks with **negative sentiment ‚â§ -0.8** by liquidating their full position.
  - **Hold** if no significant sentiment signals are present.

## üß† How Sentiment Analysis Works

1. Fetch recent news (past 7 days) using `get_web_deets()` (via Serper API or custom scraper).
2. Send news summaries to a **local LLM** (Ollama with `qwen2.5:14b`) using a prompt template.
3. Parse the LLM's response (structured JSON) to extract:
   - `sentiment`: a label (e.g., `"positive"`, `"negative"`)
   - `score`: a float in the range [-1, 1]
4. Use the score to drive weekly buy/sell decisions.
